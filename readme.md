HMS is a hospital management system that was made in 2 days as an honors project for my CSCI-143 Class. My main objective was finishing it on time, and not putting it on GitHub. That resulted in the code not being very organized and optimized. I have always wanted to program a hospital management system, and this is just the start. My short term goal is to make the code better, add more features (features listed down below) and release the source code here. And my long term goal is to reach a point where this program can be used in an actual hospital. Feel free to download the release, and try it out!
## Current Features

The backend for HMS for now is made of ArrayLists. These are the current features:

1. Dark mode and light mode
2. Sign up to use the software (username and password)
3. Log in to use the software (username and password)
4. Log out functionality
5. Add, view, edit, and delete patients
6. Add, view, edit, and delete doctors
7. A patient has: name, phone number, age, sex, blood type, address, and citizenship status
8. A doctor has: name, room number, and description

## Building

HMS was programmed and compiled using the built-in complier of the [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) IDE.
